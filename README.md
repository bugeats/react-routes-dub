# react-routes-dub

Stupid-easy React routing for the browser in 200 lines of code and with a single dependency.

That single dependency is important. [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) is used by Express to parse path strings, and now you can use it for your client-side routes.

All configuration takes place in single file and all routes are **named**, as they should be.

# Installation

    yarn add react-routes-dub


# Usage

**See [./test](./test) for now.**
